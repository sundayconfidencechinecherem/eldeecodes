    <h1> Website Planning Blueprint ~ Phase 1</h1>
    <p>
    <strong>STEP 1:</strong> 
    Define Your Core Concept: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>Get crystal clear on what you're building and why it matters.</blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>What? What is the website? (One-sentence description)</li>
        <li>Why? What problem does it solve? (The core pain point)</li>
        <li>Who? Who are you building it for? (Your primary user)</li>
        <li>How? How does it work? (The main method/action)</li>
    </ol>
</section>

    <p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Validate the Problem & Market:</p>
    <blockquote>Ensure you're solving a real problem and find your unique angle.</blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Research: Who are your competitors? What are their strengths/weaknesses?</li>
      <li>Differentiate: What will make your website unique? (Your Unique Value Proposition)</li>
      <li>Validate: Is there a real need for your solution?</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>STEP 3:</strong> Plan Features & Requirements:</p>
    <blockquote>Turn your idea into a buildable plan.</blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Brainstorm: List every possible feature without filtering.</li>
      <li>Prioritize: Use the MoSCoW method (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have).</li>
      <li>User Stories: Define features from the user's perspective. (As a [user], I want to [action]...)</li>
      <li>Acceptance Criteria: Define what "done" looks like for each story.</li>
    </ol>
